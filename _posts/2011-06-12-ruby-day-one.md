The first language in the book is Ruby.

I have been working with ruby for half a year and I already now the basics. Given that this week I am going to be really busy, I feel very lucky that the first language is one that I already know.

Why Ruby?
It is the author's choice for an OOP language. He also compares it to Mary Poppins and, basically, asserts that Ruby taught him to smile again :D

In this first day, we are told that Ruby is an interpreted language, where almost everything is an object and that it behaves mostly like a strongly typed language (even though it is duck typed).

It is a nice introduction to come of the language basics.

See you tomorrow!
