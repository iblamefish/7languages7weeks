The first language in the book is Ruby.

I have been working with ruby for half a year and I already now the basics. Given that this week I am going to be really busy, I feel very lucky that the first language is one that I already know.

Why Ruby?
It is the author's choice for an OOP language. He also compares it to Mary Poppins and, basically, asserts that Ruby taught him to smile again :D

In this first day, we are told that Ruby is an interpreted language, where almost everything is an object and that it behaves mostly like a strongly typed language (even though it is duck typed).

It is a nice introduction to the language basics.

There is one exercise for this day:

- Write a program that picks a random number. Let a player guess the number, telling the player whether the guess is too low or too high.

You can see [my solution here](https://github.com/plagelao/7languages7weeks/blob/exercises/ruby/day-1/guess_the_number.rb)

See you tomorrow!
